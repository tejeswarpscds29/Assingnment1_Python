Bisection search algorithm

The assignment is divided into three parts that simulate real-world savings problems.

📂 Files Included

ps1a.py – House Hunting

ps1b.py – Saving with a Raise

ps1c.py – Finding the Right Amount to Save

🔹 Part A: House Hunting

A program that calculates the number of months required to save enough for a 25% down payment on a house.

Assumptions:

Down payment = 25% of total cost

Annual return on investment = 4%

Initial savings = 0

Inputs:

Annual salary

Portion of salary saved (decimal)

Total house cost

Output:

Number of months required to reach the down payment

🔹 Part B: Saving with a Raise

Extension of Part A with an added feature:

Semi-annual salary raise

Additional Input:

Semi-annual raise (decimal)

The salary increases every 6 months.

🔹 Part C: Finding the Right Amount to Save

Uses the Bisection Search algorithm to determine the best savings rate needed to afford the down payment in exactly 36 months.

Assumptions:

House cost = $1,000,000

Down payment = 25%

Annual return = 4%

Semi-annual raise = 7%

Output:

Best savings rate

Number of bisection steps

Message if saving in 3 years is impossible

🧠 Concepts Used

While loops

Conditional statements

Mathematical calculations

Percentage and interest computation

Bisection search algorithm

🎯 Learning Outcomes

By completing this assignment, students will:

Understand control flow in Python

Apply financial calculations programmatically

Implement and analyze the efficiency of bisection search

Practice writing structured and well-commented Python programs
